## ***1. Cloud Computing***

Service delivery model over the internet (cloud). This includes but is not limited to:

- **Compute Power**: Servers such as Windows, Linux, hosting environments, etc.
- **Storage**: Files and/or databases.
- **Networking**: In Azure but also outside when connecting to your company network.
- **Analytics Services**: For visualization and telemetry data.

## ***2. Azure Cloud Key Characteristics***

- **Scalability**: is the ability to scale, so scaling is a process of allocating(adding) and deallocating(removing) resources at any time.
- **Elasticity**: The ability to scale dynamically(Automatic Scaling).
- **Agility**: The ability to react fast (scale quickly).
- **Fault Tolerance**: is the ability to remain up and running during component and service failure.
- **Disaster Recovery**: is the ability to recover from an event that has taken down the service(disaster), should be able to recover from natural or human-induced disasters.
- **High Availability**: is the ability to keep services running for extended periods of time with very little downtime. It is a simple calculation of system uptime versus the whole lifetime of the system.
  - `availability = uptime / (uptime + downtime)`

## ***3. CapEx vs OpEx***
Great question! Understanding the difference between CapEx (Capital Expenditure) and OpEx (Operational Expenditure) is crucial when it comes to cloud computing, especially in Azure. Let's break it down:

### **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**
- **Definition**: CapEx refers to the funds used by an organization to acquire, upgrade, or maintain physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment.
- **Usage in IT**: In traditional IT infrastructure, CapEx involves significant upfront investments in hardware, software licenses, data centers, and other physical infrastructure.
- **Benefits**: 
  - Ownership of assets
  - Potential for depreciation tax benefits
- **Challenges**:
  - High initial costs
  - Long-term commitment
  - Difficulty in scaling quickly

### **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**
- **Definition**: OpEx refers to the ongoing costs required for running day-to-day operations. These costs are incurred regularly and are often considered more flexible than CapEx.
- **Usage in IT**: In the context of cloud computing, OpEx involves the costs associated with the consumption of cloud services, such as pay-as-you-go pricing for compute, storage, and networking.
- **Benefits**:
  - Lower upfront costs
  - Greater flexibility and scalability
  - Easier to align with business needs
- **Challenges**:
  - Continuous expenses
  - Potential for higher long-term costs if not managed effectively

### **CapEx vs. OpEx in Azure**
| Feature                     | CapEx                                          | OpEx                                          |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Initial Investment**      | High                                           | Low                                           |
| **Flexibility**             | Limited                                        | High                                          |
| **Scalability**             | Challenging and slow                           | Quick and easy                                |
| **Cost Management**         | Fixed over time                                | Variable based on usage                       |
| **Ownership of Assets**     | Yes                                            | No                                            |
| **Depreciation**            | Can claim tax benefits                         | Not applicable                                |
| **Use Case**                | Traditional on-premises IT infrastructure     | Cloud-based services and consumption models  |

In summary, **CapEx** involves substantial initial investments in physical assets and is more common in traditional IT setups. In contrast, **OpEx** allows for more flexibility and scalability, aligning with the dynamic nature of cloud computing, where costs are based on actual usage.

Moving to a cloud platform like Azure shifts many costs from CapEx to OpEx, which can provide significant financial and operational advantages for businesses.
