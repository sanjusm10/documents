Moving to a cloud platform like Azure shifts many costs from CapEx to OpEx, which can provide significant financial and operational advantages for businesses.

## ***4. What is a Consumption-Based Model?***

The consumption-based model is a pricing model used in the cloud where customers are charged based on their resource usage.

This model is characterized by:

- **No Upfront Cost**: There are no associated upfront costs.
- **No Wasted Resources**: Charges are incurred only for used resources. For instance, blob storage that stores data is considered used as it consumes storage space. Virtual Machines that are running consume CPU, memory, and other resources even if there isn’t any traffic, hence they are considered used and will incur charges.
- **Pay for What You Need**: Customers pay only for the resources they need.
- **Stop Paying When You Don’t**: Charges stop when the resources are no longer needed.

![CostAnalysis](Images/CostAnalysis.png)

Consumption is the virtual metric used to calculate how much each resource (service) in Azure was used. Each service has many smaller metrics that track its consumption to offer the best possible pricing model. These metrics are tracked at a very granular level.

## ***12. Azure Network Security Group (NSG)***

Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) are essential for securing your Azure resources by controlling inbound and outbound network traffic to and from Azure resources. Here's a detailed explanation of NSGs:

### **Definition**

- **Network Security Group (NSG)**: An Azure resource that acts as a virtual firewall, allowing you to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure Virtual Network (VNet).

### **Key Features**

1. **Rule-Based Filtering**: NSGs contain security rules that allow or deny inbound and outbound traffic based on various criteria like source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
2. **Stateful Rules**: NSG rules are stateful, meaning they automatically allow return traffic for an outbound connection that matches an inbound rule.
3. **Flexible Deployment**: NSGs can be applied to individual network interfaces, VMs, or subnets, providing flexible control over network traffic.
4. **Priority-Based Rules**: Each rule has a priority, and rules are evaluated in order of their priority, from lowest to highest.
5. **Logging and Monitoring**: NSGs support logging through Network Security Group Flow Logs, which allow you to monitor and analyze network traffic.

### **Key Components**
- **Inbound Security Rules**: Control incoming traffic to Azure resources. Each rule specifies the allowed or denied traffic.
- **Outbound Security Rules**: Control outgoing traffic from Azure resources. Each rule specifies the allowed or denied traffic.
- **Default Security Rules**: NSGs come with a set of default security rules that allow essential traffic (e.g., internal communication within the VNet) and deny others by default. These can be overridden with custom rules.

### **How NSGs Work**
1. **Association with Resources**: You can associate an NSG with a subnet or a network interface. If associated with both, the rules are applied cumulatively.
2. **Evaluation of Rules**: Traffic is evaluated against the security rules in order of priority. The first matching rule is applied, and no further rules are evaluated for that traffic.
3. **Stateful Processing**: Once a rule allows or denies traffic, the corresponding return traffic is automatically allowed.

### **Examples of NSG Rules**
| Priority | Source IP | Source Port | Destination IP | Destination Port | Protocol | Action |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|------------------|----------|--------|
| 100      | Any       | Any         | Any            | 80               | TCP      | Allow  |
| 200      | Any       | Any         | Any            | 443              | TCP      | Allow  |
| 300      | VirtualNetwork | Any    | VirtualNetwork | Any              | Any      | Allow  |
| 400      | Any       | Any         | Any            | Any              | Any      | Deny   |

### **Use Cases**
- **Web Application Protection**: Restrict inbound traffic to web servers to specific IP addresses or ranges, allowing only HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic.
- **Database Security**: Control access to database servers by allowing only specific VMs or subnets to communicate with the database servers.
- **Microsegmentation**: Segment your network into smaller, isolated zones with specific security rules, improving overall network security.

### **Benefits**
- **Enhanced Security**: NSGs provide granular control over network traffic, enhancing the security of Azure resources.
- **Ease of Management**: NSGs can be managed through the Azure portal, Azure CLI, PowerShell, or ARM templates, making it easy to define and apply security policies.
- **Compliance**: NSGs help meet compliance requirements by enforcing network security policies and logging traffic flow for auditing purposes.

### **Summary**
Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) are critical for controlling and securing network traffic to and from Azure resources. With features like rule-based filtering, stateful rules, and flexible deployment, NSGs provide robust security and management capabilities, ensuring that your Azure infrastructure is protected from unauthorized access and potential threats.
