## ***1. How to reduce cost in Azure?***

Reducing costs in Azure can be achieved through several strategies and best practices. Here are some effective ways to optimize your Azure spending:

### 1. **Right-Sizing Resources**
- **Adjust the size and type of Azure resources** to match actual usage requirements. Use Azure Advisor to identify underutilized resources and resize or shut them down.

### 2. **Shut Down Unused Resources**
- **Identify and shut down idle resources** such as virtual machines, ExpressRoute circuits, and other services that are not in use. Azure Advisor can help you find these resources.

### 3. **Implement Reserved Instances and Savings Plans**
- **Purchase reserved instances** for consistent workloads to get discounts of up to 72% over pay-as-you-go pricing.
- **Use Azure savings plans** for dynamic workloads to save up to 65% off pay-as-you-go pricing.

### 4. **Utilize Azure Hybrid Benefit**
- **Migrate on-premises workloads to Azure** and take advantage of the Azure Hybrid Benefit to save on licensing costs.

### 5. **Configure Autoscaling**
- **Set up autoscaling** to dynamically allocate and deallocate resources based on performance needs, ensuring you only pay for what you use.

### 6. **Set Budgets and Alerts**
- **Create budgets and alerts** to monitor and control spending. This helps you stay within your budget and avoid unexpected costs.

### 7. **Tagging and Resource Organization**
- **Use tags to organize resources** and track costs by project, department, or any other criteria. This makes it easier to analyze and manage expenses.

### 8. **Regularly Review and Optimize Subscriptions**
- **Regularly review your Azure subscriptions** and optimize them based on usage patterns and needs.

### 9. **Leverage Storage Tiers**
- **Use different storage tiers** based on usage requirements to save on storage costs.

### 10. **Follow Best Practices**
- **Follow Azure Well-Architected Framework** guidelines and recommendations from Azure Advisor to ensure your architecture is cost-efficient.

By implementing these strategies, you can significantly reduce your Azure costs while maintaining performance and reliability. 

## ***2. What is use of reserved instances in Azure?***
Azure Reserved Instances are a pricing option that allows you to commit to using Azure services for a one or three-year term in exchange for significant discounts, up to **72% off** compared to pay-as-you-go pricing. Here's a detailed explanation:

### **How Azure Reserved Instances Work**
1. **Commitment**: You commit to using a specific Azure service (like virtual machines, SQL databases, or Azure Cosmos DB) for a one or three-year term.
2. **Discounts**: In return for this commitment, you receive a discount on the hourly rate for the resources you use.
3. **Payment Options**: You can pay for the reservation upfront for the entire term or choose a monthly payment option without any extra cost.
4. **Flexibility**: If your needs change, you can modify the scope of the reservation, split it between different subscriptions, or even cancel it with a refund for the unused portion (subject to an early termination fee).

### **Benefits of Azure Reserved Instances**
- **Cost Savings**: Significant discounts (up to 72%) compared to pay-as-you-go pricing.
- **Budgeting and Forecasting**: Upfront payment simplifies budgeting and forecasting.
- **Prioritized Compute Capacity**: Gain access to prioritized compute capacity in Azure regions.
- **Instance Size Flexibility**: Discounts apply to VMs in the same series or data center capacity for a specific VM size.

### **Use Cases**
Azure Reserved Instances are ideal for workloads with predictable usage patterns, such as:
- **Production Workloads**: Applications and services running continuously.
- **Development and Testing**: Environments that are used regularly but not 24/7.
- **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Systems that need to be available but not always active.

### **Optimizing Usage**
To maximize the benefits of Azure Reserved Instances:
- **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of your resource usage to ensure you're fully utilizing the reservation.
- **Adjust Scope**: Change the scope of the reservation if your usage patterns change.
- **Combine with Hybrid Benefit**: Combine Azure Reserved Instances with Azure Hybrid Benefit for additional savings.

By committing to Azure Reserved Instances, you can significantly reduce your cloud costs while maintaining flexibility and control over your resources.

## ***3. What is API Throttling?***
API throttling is a technique used to control the rate at which clients can send requests to an API. It's essential for ensuring the stability and reliability of an API by preventing overloading, abuse, and unintended spikes in traffic. Here's a detailed explanation:

### **Why Use API Throttling?**
1. **Protect Resources**: Prevent the server and backend systems from being overwhelmed by excessive requests.
2. **Ensure Fair Usage**: Make sure all users have fair access to the API without any single user monopolizing the resources.
3. **Prevent Abuse**: Mitigate the risk of malicious attacks, such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
4. **Control Costs**: Avoid unexpected costs due to excessive usage.

### **How API Throttling Works**
- **Rate Limits**: Set limits on the number of requests that can be made within a specified time frame (e.g., 1000 requests per minute).
- **Tokens/Buckets**: Use token bucket algorithms or leaky bucket algorithms to manage request limits. Tokens are added to a bucket at a fixed rate, and each request consumes a token. If the bucket is empty, the request is throttled.
- **HTTP Status Codes**: When throttling is applied, the API typically responds with HTTP status codes like 429 (Too Many Requests) to inform the client that they need to slow down.

### **Implementation Strategies**
- **Fixed Window**: Limit the number of requests within a fixed time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute).
- **Sliding Window**: Limit requests based on a sliding time window, offering more granular control.
- **Exponential Backoff**: Implement a strategy where the client waits progressively longer intervals before retrying a request after being throttled.

### **Best Practices**
- **Rate Limit Headers**: Include rate limit information in the response headers so clients know their usage status.
- **Retry Logic**: Encourage clients to implement retry logic with exponential backoff to handle throttled requests gracefully.
- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor API usage patterns and adjust throttling limits as needed.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Provide partial or degraded service instead of completely denying access when limits are exceeded.

By implementing API throttling, you can maintain the performance, reliability, and security of your API, ensuring a better experience for all users.
