Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes modeling the domain based on the real-world business context. It aims to create a shared understanding between developers and domain experts, focusing on the core domain logic and avoiding technical complexities. Here's an example of how you might implement a simple domain-driven architecture in C#.

### **Example Scenario: Online Bookstore**

#### **1. Domain Layer**
The domain layer includes entities, value objects, aggregates, and domain services. It represents the core business logic.

**Entity**:
```csharp
public class Book
{
    public Guid Id { get; private set; }
    public string Title { get; private set; }
    public string Author { get; private set; }
    public decimal Price { get; private set; }

    public Book(Guid id, string title, string author, decimal price)
    {
        Id = id;
        Title = title;
        Author = author;
        Price = price;
    }

    public void UpdatePrice(decimal newPrice)
    {
        Price = newPrice;
    }
}
```

**Value Object**:
```csharp
public class Money
{
    public decimal Amount { get; private set; }
    public string Currency { get; private set; }

    public Money(decimal amount, string currency)
    {
        Amount = amount;
        Currency = currency;
    }
}
```

**Repository Interface**:
```csharp
public interface IBookRepository
{
    Book GetById(Guid id);
    void Add(Book book);
    void Update(Book book);
}
```

**Domain Service**:
```csharp
public class BookPricingService
{
    private readonly IBookRepository _bookRepository;

    public BookPricingService(IBookRepository bookRepository)
    {
        _bookRepository = bookRepository;
    }

    public void UpdateBookPrice(Guid bookId, decimal newPrice)
    {
        var book = _bookRepository.GetById(bookId);
        book.UpdatePrice(newPrice);
        _bookRepository.Update(book);
    }
}
```

#### **2. Application Layer**
The application layer orchestrates domain logic by coordinating domain services, repositories, and other components.

**Application Service**:
```csharp
public class BookService
{
    private readonly IBookRepository _bookRepository;
    private readonly BookPricingService _bookPricingService;

    public BookService(IBookRepository bookRepository, BookPricingService bookPricingService)
    {
        _bookRepository = bookRepository;
        _bookPricingService = bookPricingService;
    }

    public void AddNewBook(string title, string author, decimal price)
    {
        var book = new Book(Guid.NewGuid(), title, author, price);
        _bookRepository.Add(book);
    }

    public void ChangeBookPrice(Guid bookId, decimal newPrice)
    {
        _bookPricingService.UpdateBookPrice(bookId, newPrice);
    }
}
```

#### **3. Infrastructure Layer**
The infrastructure layer implements the repository interfaces and handles data persistence.

**Repository Implementation**:
```csharp
public class BookRepository : IBookRepository
{
    private readonly List<Book> _books = new List<Book>();

    public Book GetById(Guid id)
    {
        return _books.FirstOrDefault(b => b.Id == id);
    }

    public void Add(Book book)
    {
        _books.Add(book);
    }

    public void Update(Book book)
    {
        var existingBook = GetById(book.Id);
        if (existingBook != null)
        {
            _books.Remove(existingBook);
            _books.Add(book);
        }
    }
}
```

### **4. Presentation Layer**
The presentation layer interacts with users and calls the application services.

**Example Console Application**:
```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        IBookRepository bookRepository = new BookRepository();
        BookPricingService bookPricingService = new BookPricingService(bookRepository);
        BookService bookService = new BookService(bookRepository, bookPricingService);

        // Add a new book
        bookService.AddNewBook("Domain-Driven Design", "Eric Evans", 45.99m);

        // Change the price of the book
        var book = bookRepository.GetById(Guid.NewGuid());
        if (book != null)
        {
            bookService.ChangeBookPrice(book.Id, 39.99m);
        }
    }
}
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Domain Layer**: Defines the core business logic and rules. Entities, value objects, repositories, and domain services are part of this layer.
2. **Application Layer**: Orchestrates domain logic and coordinates between different components.
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Implements data access and persistence.
4. **Presentation Layer**: Interacts with users and calls application services.

This example illustrates a simple domain-driven architecture for an online bookstore. 
The concepts can be expanded and refined based on the complexity and specific requirements of your application.
